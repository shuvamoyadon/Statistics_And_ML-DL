1. What is statistics?
   It is a fields which helps us to understand,analyze and predict the data in a very meaningful manner.
     * Understanding of data
     * Make decision using data points
     * Predict the future based on the data points

2. Descriptive vs Inferential?
   
      Descriptive: Descriptive statistics helps to describe a raw data using summary statistics, graphs, and tables.
      Example: When we interest the average score of all students with the distribution test score. We can create graph to visualize the data.
   
      Three forms of descriptive statistics:
      
      1.Summary statistics - Helps to summarize the data
      
         *  Measures of central tendency : It describe the center of a dataset. Ex: Mean and Median
         *  Measure of dispersion : It describes how the data are dispersed or spreaded. Ex: Range,Standard deviation,variance,interquartile range. 
      
      2.Graphs - We can analysize the data in representing the data points in the graph. There are various types of graph like Boxplots,histogram,scatterplot.
