  * Use of Deep Learning
  
  ## What is Deep Learning?
  
   1) It's a another technique of ML and that learns features and takes input directly from data.
   2) Data directly feeds to the Deep Learning Algorithim.
   3) It's is processed by Neural networks.
   4) Neural Network have hidden layers.
   
   ## Difference between ML and DL
     
     * ML-  Feature Extraction is challenging. Cant work on complex problem like object detection/Handwriting recognization.
     * DL - Feature Extraction is not challenging. It works on object detection/Handwriting recognization.
     
   ## What is Neuron and Perception?
   
      * Neuron: 
        1) Neurons are cells in the nervous system
        2) They are interconnected with other neurons
        3) It passes signils to each others.
        
     * Perceptron:
       1) Perceptron is a type of artificial neural network which is used to classify patterns.
       2) It is a supervised learning algorithim .It needs labeled input data to learn.
       3) They only learn linear function.
       4) Cant be connected to each other.
