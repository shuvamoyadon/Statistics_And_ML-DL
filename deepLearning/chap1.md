  * Why Deep Learning?
  * Use of Deep Learning
  
  ## What is Deep Learning?
  
   1) It's a another technique of ML and that learns features and takes input directly from data.
   2) Data directly feeds to the Deep Learning Algorithim.
   3) It's is processed by Neural networks.
   4) Neural Network have hidden layers.
   
   ## Difference between ML and DL
     
     * ML-  Feature Extraction is challenging. Cant work on complex problem like object detection/Handwriting recognization.
     * DL - Feature Extraction is not challenging. It works on object detection/Handwriting recognization.
