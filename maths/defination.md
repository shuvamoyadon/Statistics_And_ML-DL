What is Vector? 

* Vetor is a list of numbers which we can visualize it in space.

* Vecor can start from any point in the plane. 
* Vector can be notated like these below ways: 
        Using an arrow : -> 
        Using boldface : V
        
 * Vector represent in one column is referred to as column vector

 In Python numpy
# 2-dimensional vector
v2 = [7,-2]
v2=np.array([v2])
v2.T

* Vector represent in one row is referred to as row vector.

# 3-dimensional vector'
v3 = [4,8,9]
v3 = np.array(v3)
v3

To plot the two and three dimentional vector . Below is the price of code: (refer the code in vector1.py
